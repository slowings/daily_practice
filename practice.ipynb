    "Up until now I've worked almost exclusively with data that had very straightforward access- files were formatted as csv's and were contained withing a simple zip file.  But recently I started a text summarization project with data that has a messy file structure, and I realized that accessing files is a practical skill worth building also.  In this notebook I'll start by working on a code along from Real Python, and using those skills, navigate to the files I'm looking for in the BBC news dataset.  These files are also in .txt form, so we'll need to convert those string as well."
